It is only after \u2018growing up\u2019 to a certain age that human beings and many other animals can reproduce. Why can humans reproduce only after a certain age?\nIn this chapter, you will learn about changes that take place in the human body after which a person becomes capable of reproduction.\nIn Chapter 6, you have learnt about human reproductive organs. Here, we shall discuss the role that hormones play in bringing about changes that make a child grow into an adult."
